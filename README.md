# WikiParse
Another WikiText aka. WikiCode aka. MediaWiki Parser - because I had various issues with others.

*WikiParse* uses a completely different approach and a completely custom parser with few dependencies. It is designed to allow extension of syntax and to create more distinct yet generic abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
